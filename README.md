## Objective:

Create a web application that lists all the Pokemons captured by the user.

## API:

You will use this [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) in order to fetch the Pokemons.

## Business Requirements:

* Demonstrate that there is a form with an input text field to catch a new Pokemon by `name`.
* Demonstrate that when the `catch` button is clicked the new Pokemon is included in the list.
* Demonstrate that  the `name`, `id` and `image` of every Pokemon is displayed in the list.
* Demonstrate that when there are no Pokemons, the list should show the state: `No Pokemons captured yet`.
